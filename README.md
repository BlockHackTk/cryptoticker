# CryptoTicker

Extension for Visual Studio Code -  Allows you to keep track of all the different crypto coin values in the currencies you prefer on the status bar

## Features

Add as many Crypto coin symbols as you like to the status bar, and they will be updated every 60 seconds. Just set `cryptoticker.cryptoSymbols` to an array of stock symbols to monitor. Example:
```json
"cryptoticker.cryptoSymbols": [
    "BTC",
    "ETH",
    "XMR"
    ],
       
```
